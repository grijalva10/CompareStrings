# RFC-3986 URI component:  query
(?:\? (⌽ (?:[A-Za-z0-9\-._~!$&'()*+,;=:@/?]|%[0-9A-Fa-f]{2}☯)✪) )? # DFH modified to capture just the query
# DFH Addition: change ☯ to "|[\u0080-\U0010ffff]" to get inline Unicode detection (making this an IRI, not a URI, but you can later hex encode it), or "" for standard behavior
# DFH Addition: change ⌽ from "?:" to "" to get capture groups of the various components
# DFH Addition: set '✪' to '*' for standard behavior, to '+' for "force user to enter at least one character after the '?'
